## Getting Started

As I embark on the adventure of blogging once again (yes, I've tried this a few times) I can't help but feel nostalgic 
about posts I've made in the past. But as I consider posting I don't think I want to start with a bunch links to old 
blog posts, I'll save those for a time when I'm running low on time.

So instead I want to give a brief overview of my career thus far so there can be some background for where my opinions 
come from.

I started developing software for money when I was in high school. My family is very entrepreneurial so there were 
plenty of opportunities for me to help. My first project was helping my cousin, [Nate Beck](http://blog.natebeck.net/), 
with a few Flash and PHP clients. From there I took on building a few projects on my own from scratch. Both of these 
were custom PHP applications and I still avoided JavaScript for anything beyond basic input validation / formatting.

After high school I started my college career at [NAU](http://nau.edu/) where I worked in the school's IT department, 
and learned that I really preferred programming. I took a break after my first year in college to go on a mission for my 
church, [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](http://www.mormon.org/). After that I returned to NAU for 
another semester and then my career began to change.

I moved from Flagstaff, AZ to Tempe, AZ which necessitated a change in jobs, and this time I found a small Web 
Development shop, called [AZ Pixels](http://www.azpixels.com/), to work at. This is where I began to learn about
JavaScript, and some of the dangers of PHP. This is also a place where I learned a lot about the importance of a good 
development workflow.

After working at AZ Pixels for a year and a half I moved on to a job doing a
[staff augmentation contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_augmentation) for Kodak Gallery. This was my first job 
where JavaScript was my primary language. Up to this point I had been doing web development, but it had been primarily 
PHP with a bit of JavaScript sprinkled in. When I moved to Kodak Gallery I focused soley on JavaScript and front-end 
development.

During the time I was at AZ Pixels and Kodak Gallery I was still working closely with [Nate](http://blog.natebeck.net/)
and helping out on projects from time to time. This work drifted further and further into the realm of Flash and Flex 
development, and was a nice counter point to the strong JavaScript experience I was getting at Kodak Gallery. During 
this time I spoke at a couple [360 Flex](http://www.360flex.com/) conferences and made my first few real open source 
contributions.

After I graduated I wanted to try a change of pace so I moved to Seattle and worked for Microsoft. I was only there for 
a short time, but in that time I dove into C# and SilverLight. While the platform was already in its death throws at the 
time it was great to gain exposure to yet another technology for delivering solid interactive experiences on the web.

Next I tried another big corporation and worked for Amazon Web Services working with JavaScript again starting to define
their new generation of web consoles. When I first arrived on my team they had just begun porting their old console to 
GWT so I got to have exposure to another front-end web technology. After finishing that console we decided to write the 
next conosle in a native JavaScript framework, and decided to use [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). We liked Angular
so much that we decided to rewrite our GWT console in Angular.

After a year and a half at AWS life brought me to New York City where I found a job at a great [personal investment](https://www.betterment.com/)
startup named [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/). Betterment was a great place to work, and they had a great
native JavaScript application using Backbone and Marrionette. I was able to learn quite a bit about those technologies
and the feel of working at a small company.

After less than a year life brought me back to Seattle where I've found a job at another great startup that does [wire level analytics](http://www.extrahop.com/products/wire-data/)
called [ExtraHop](http://www.extrahop.com/). ExtraHop has some products that are currently being migrated from Flex to
AngularJS as well as a diverse set of web properties. We'll have to see where things go with ExtraHop.
