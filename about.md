I'm a Software Engineer specializing in web development. I have experience in many languages, frameworks and architectures, but my most valuable assets are my ability to quickly learn and communicate new concepts. The ability to communicate clearly technical concepts and business concepts has allowed me to breathe life into some of my most advantageous projects.

Over the past few years I have worked with many popular backend technologies (Node JS, Java, C# .NET, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra) as well as many frontend technologies (Angular.js, Backbone, Marionette, Flex GWT, and Silverlight). This breadth of experience has given me the ability to get up to speed on projects quickly and structure applications in a maintainable manner, allowing for long term stability and speed of development.
